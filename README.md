# Basic Language Detector
Language Detector is a basic web application that detects the language of text typed in by users. Sentences are analyzed using a classifier model trained on paragraphs from Wikipedia in different languages (12 languages initially).

## Setup
The primary dependency for the web server itself is Flask. The latest version of Anaconda can help as well; a somewhat conprehensive list if packages is listed in "requirements.txt". 

Run the Flask web server locally via
```
python controller.py
```
